### Wave Modulation Simulator ###  

**Description**

Wave Modulation Simulator is a web based application designed to simulate various types of wave modulation techniques. The project allows users to visualize and understand concepts like Amplitude Modulation (AM), Frequency Modulation (FM), Phase Modulation (PM), Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK), Frequency Shift Keying (FSK), and Phase Shift Keying (PSK) in a simple and interactive manner.

**How to Use**

1. Select Modulation Type: Choose the type of modulation from the dropdown menu (AM, FM, PM, ASK, FSK, PSK).
2. Enter Parameters: Depending on the selected modulation type, enter relevant parameters such as carrier frequency, message frequency, amplitude, deviation, bit rate, etc.
3. Start Simulation: Click the "Start" button to initiate the modulation simulation.
4. Visualize Output: The canvas will display the modulated wave based on the selected parameters.

**Modulation Types**

- AM (Amplitude Modulation): Modulates the carrier signal's amplitude based on the message signal.
- FM (Frequency Modulation): Modulates the carrier signal's frequency based on the message signal.
- PM (Phase Modulation): Modulates the carrier signal's phase based on the message signal.
- ASK (Amplitude Shift Keying): Modulates the carrier signal's amplitude to represent digital data.
- FSK (Frequency Shift Keying): Modulates between two carrier frequencies to represent digital data.
- PSK (Phase Shift Keying): Modulates the carrier signal's phase to represent digital data.

**Features**

- Interactive Interface: Easy-to-use interface with dropdown menus and input fields for parameter selection.
- Real-time Simulation: Simulates modulation techniques in real-time, providing immediate visual feedback.
- Dynamic Display: Canvas display dynamically updates to show the modulated waveforms.
- Night Mode: Toggle between light and dark themes for improved visibility.

**Technologies Used**

- HTML5 for structuring the web page.
- CSS3 for styling and theme management.
- JavaScript for interactive functionality and simulation logic.
- Canvas API for drawing and visualizing waveforms.

Now, after selecting modulation type and putting all the data will get the modulated waves like this:
